      Saying, "working with Cas has been a delight,” just doesn't do her justice. Not only does she work to deliver the day-to-day, she sets her sights on continued learning, developing her skills and discovering new ways to expand her areas of expertise. An easy-going personality paired with an enviable work ethic, Cas sets herself apart from the grind of the corporate world, fitting it into her life instead of fitting her life into it – a perspective of which I have equal parts envy and admiration." <br />

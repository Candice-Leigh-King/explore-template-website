          In 2016, Candy and Jonty helped me turn my passion into a career. We
          brainstormed together and got all my ideas out on paper which was the
          beginning of my fitness business, CazFit. (I still have that piece of
          paper we scribbled all my ideas on.) They also did some corporate
          branding for me (I have 4 pages of different logo designs she helped
          me with, they also designed my double-sided business cards and my
          invoice template). <br>Their work ethic went above and beyond my
          expectations, and Candy made herself available to my requests at all
          hours. <br> I also hired them to consult me with my social media
          pages. After  helping me setup my business Facebook page and Instagram
          page, they taught me the basics of social media management so I have
          been able to manage my accounts myself. <br>Their service really is
          incredible and I'm definitely going to be going to them to redesign my
          website. I wouldn't go to anyone else! 😁

          King Code completely changed my life. They built a customized website
          for me from scratch. We met on zoom for the first time and I briefly
          told them what my vision was and they completely made it come true.
          They also helped me come up with content ideas for my Instagram which
          I am so thankful for. I honestly wouldn’t choose anyone else to build
          my website and be a part of my team! ❤️

          Candy and Jonty have not only gone above and beyond to make my website
          exactly how I want it, but they are just absolute gems to work with.
          Candy understood my vision immediately and gave great input to make it
          even better. She quickly made an aesthetically beautiful website that
          I’m so proud to call my own. Candy and Jonty are amazing people who
          turn your dreams into reality!
